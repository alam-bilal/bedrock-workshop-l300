    "# Code Executors\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last chapter, \n",
    "we used two agents powered by a large language model (LLM) to play a game\n",
    "by exchanging messages.\n",
    "In this chapter, we introduce code executors, which enable agents to not just chat\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In AutoGen, a code executor is a component that\n",
    "takes input messages (e.g., those containing code blocks), performs execution, and outputs messages\n",
    "with the results.\n",
    "AutoGen provides two types of built-in code executors, one is \n",
    "command line code executor, which runs code in a command line environment\n",
    "such as a UNIX shell, and the other is Jupyter executor, which runs code\n",
    "in an interactive [Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each type of executor, AutoGen provides two ways to execute code: locally and in a Docker container.\n",
    "One way is to execute\n",
    "code directly in the same host platform where AutoGen is running, i.e.,\n",
    "the local operating system.\n",
    "It is for development and testing, but it is not ideal for production\n",
    "as LLM can generate arbitrary code.\n",
    "The other way is to execute code in a Docker container.\n",
