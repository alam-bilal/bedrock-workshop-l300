    "# Introduction to Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "    An agent consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Foundation model – You choose a foundation model (FM) that the agent invokes to interpret user input and subsequent prompts in its orchestration process. The agent also invokes the FM to generate responses and follow-up steps in its process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Instructions – You write instructions that describe what the agent is designed to do. With advanced prompts, you can further customize instructions for the agent at every step of orchestration and include Lambda functions to parse each step's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    At least one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Action groups – You define the actions that the agent should perform for the user through providing the following resources):\n",
    "\n",
    "            One of the following schemas to define the parameters that the agent needs to elicit from the user (each action group can use a different schema):\n",
    "\n",
    "                An OpenAPI schema to define the API operations that the agent can invoke to perform its tasks. The OpenAPI schema includes the parameters that need to be elicited from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "                A function detail schema to define the parameters that the agent can elicit from the user. These parameters can then be used for further orchestration by the agent, or you can set up how to use them in your own application.\n",
    "\n",
    "            (Optional) A Lambda function with the following input and output:\n",
    "\n",
    "                Input – The API operation and/or parameters identified during orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "                Output – The response from the API invocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Knowledge bases – Associate knowledge bases with an agent. The agent queries the knowledge base for extra context to augment response generation and input into steps of the orchestration process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prompt templates – Prompt templates are the basis for creating prompts to be provided to the FM. Agents for Amazon Bedrock exposes the default four base prompt templates that are used during the pre-processing, orchestration, knowledge base response generation, and post-processing. You can optionally edit these base prompt templates to customize your agent's behavior at each step of its sequence. You can also turn off steps for troubleshooting purposes or if you decide that a step is unnecessary. For more information, see Advanced prompts in Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "    At build-time, all these components are gathered to construct base prompts for the agent to perform orchestration until the user request is completed. With advanced prompts, you can modify these base prompts with additional logic and few-shot examples to improve accuracy for each step of agent invocation. The base prompt templates contain instructions, action descriptions, knowledge base descriptions, and conversation history, all of which you can customize to modify the agent to meet your needs. You then prepare your agent, which packages all the components of the agents, including security configurations. Preparing the agent brings it into a state where it can be tested in runtime. The following image shows how build-time API operations construct your agent.\n",
